# Hog - Simple property testing for Rust

Hog is a minimally featured property testing library, favouring explicitness over macros and magic.

One day it hopes to grow in to a proper Hedgehog implementation https://github.com/hedgehogqa/haskell-hedgehog .

Shrinking won't be included until a nice integrated shrinking approach is finished.

## Non-goals

* Type directed shrinking.
* Arbitrary.
* Significant macro usage.
